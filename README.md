Iâ€™m a passionate and driven aspiring Physical Design Engineer with a strong interest in Digital IC Design and AI Accelerators. As a fresher, I bring curiosity, dedication, and a willingness to tackle challenges by exploring new approaches and learning continuously.

While Iâ€™ve gained hands-on experience with industry-standard tools through my training, what I value most is the opportunity to learn from experienced engineers and be part of a collaborative, knowledge-sharing environment.

ðŸ”§ My objective is simple: to contribute meaningfully to my teamâ€™s success, grow as a Physical Design Engineer, and keep learning and evolving every step of the way.
